      <p>Intro Common sense, as we know it has not yet been achieved in machines by any means despite decades of research. Today&rsquo;s large language models still struggle even the smallest of riddles or mental math questions. With LLMs, we have solved language, not logic/common sense.
AI is still very narrow. There are models which are &ldquo;experts&rdquo; at certain tasks, but none posess any general capabilities. AI as we know it today us super good at narrow domains like video games and image captioning.</p>

      <p>Scaling Autoregressive Models for Content-Rich Text to Image Generation The architecture itself that&rsquo;s used for parti (that&rsquo;s what the authors call this model) is fairly simple. It&rsquo;s a transformer encoder-decoder architecture paired with a ViT VQGAN in the end to tokenize/detokenize images.
How do we tokenize images? For an autoregressive model to work, we basically have to convert everything to tokens. Tokenizing text is super easy. The problem in this case is that we also have to convert images into a sequence of tokens.</p>

      <p>I will start by rambling a little about how learning language is harder than you think. Then I&rsquo;ll move on to the main paper itself.
Learning language is harder than you think An interesting point that was made in the article was that a language is learned not entirely through memorization. Sentences like I breaked the window are grammatically invalid, but they still manage to get the meaning accross. We manage to make a meaningful fact tuple i.</p>
