      <p>A perfectly known future is already the past When you’re on a long train journey through India, you’ll see a lot of “small stations” where most of the trains dont stop. Even if they do, that’s usually not for the sake of someone to get off/board the train. The trains stop there only when they’re ahead of time, or if they have some issue with the route ahead.
When I look at these stations, I feel a weird urge to get off into that small station, especially during night time.</p>

      <p>I live in a place where we have a lot of pigeons, most of them live in the abandoned/unused flats in some of the buildings. Nobody likes them, but still you&rsquo;ll see little bowls of grains and water on a large number of the windows. We don&rsquo;t like them, but we feed them anyways.
I personally keep a bowl of water too. When they see that the bowl&rsquo;s empty, they just stare into it and then fly away after a while.</p>

      <p>Not far from the city of Kolkata lies a small district where you&rsquo;ll still find people living lives long forgotten by the city dwellers. It&rsquo;s a place which still prefers to watch the world zoom ahead through one of it&rsquo;s national highways. This post is a small and rather forgettable (unless you&rsquo;re the author himself) memoir of some of my overly specific memories in Purulia.
Of course like any other road-trip I&rsquo;ve taken with my brother and my dad, this one also started with us stopping by in the morning for chaa/chai (bengali/hindi for &ldquo;tea&rdquo;) on a small shop near Shaktigarh.</p>
