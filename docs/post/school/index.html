    <p>One of my older posts describes a little bit about my experiences in school. But at this point I feel like it deserves a place of it&rsquo;s own. Which is here.</p>
<p>The school in which I spent a large part of my childhood was Amrita Vidyalayam Kolkata. It was the first time that I had the chance to ride on a school bus. The problem with the bus was that it&rsquo;s pickup point was a little far from home. So my dad used to take me and my brother from our home to Chowrasta in a rickshaw. There we waited for a while until the bus came. One particular incident that I remember was when me and munna got off the bus, but was not able to see ma or papa waiting for us. It was one of the first times I felt consciously lost with strangers all around. It lasted only for a couple minutes until Ma found us. She was holding a brand new emergency light in her hand.</p>
<p>From the next month onwards, we left the school but because it was inconvenient. Instead we opted for a new car pool, it was a red Tata Magic. It had seat covers colored green with red checkered stripes on it. For most of the days, I sat in the rearmost left seat. The advantage of that seat was that I did not have to wait for everyone to get off to be able to get off myself. The car itself was horrendously slow, it took about 1.5 hours to return home from school.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things to do was to sit and look back at the cars behind and the gullies. Ma used to pack in Treat JimJam biscuits almost everyday, which we shared with whoever was there in the car with us. Shourjya was the name of the guy who lived nearby, and also went to the same school as us. I remember his grandfather used to come to drop him off to the car, his majestic moustache reminded us of Khadak Singh.</p>
<p>On winters, Ma used to make us wear hoodies on top of our sweaters, and also beanies and mufflers. But as soon as we were out of the area, me and munna used to take off our mufflers and sweaters to start looking like normal humans again. After papa got us a cycle at around class 6, he himself used it to go to the bazaar in the morning. Sometimes he chased our car, I loved it when he chased and rode fast to stay close to the car until we reached the bazaar.</p>
<p>On Summers,</p>
