    <p>I live in a place where we have a lot of pigeons, most of them live in the abandoned/unused flats in some of the buildings. Nobody likes them, but still you&rsquo;ll see little bowls of grains and water on a large number of the windows. We don&rsquo;t like them, but we feed them anyways.</p>
<p>I personally keep a bowl of water too. When they see that the bowl&rsquo;s empty, they just stare into it and then fly away after a while. It&rsquo;s been over 5 years I give them water, but still they fly away when I open the window to refill the bowl. They don&rsquo;t like humans, but they like water.</p>
<p>I found them to be stupid. But as years pass, that statement seems ironic. All that they do is eat grains, drink water and convert all of that to poop. Even though they have wings, they don&rsquo;t fly to far off lands in search of paradise, or beauty or whatever it is that they&rsquo;ve always wanted.</p>
<p>I find it both sad and amusing that we&rsquo;re after all not so different from them. The aliens must be laughing at us the way we laugh at pigeons for being dumb enough to not fly to exotic places even when they have wings. The little green men laugh because we choose to stay on this little rock and try to play the game of <em>&ldquo;who gets to hoard the largest heap of papers with numbers on them&rdquo;</em>. We chose not to go out there and explore other nearby rocks (at least the red one that&rsquo;s close to us).</p>
<p>Perhaps one day, I&rsquo;ll no longer see the pigeons on the window to the left of my seat. No longer would I have to fill up the bowl every noon, and no longer will we laugh at them. Because they&rsquo;ll be gone in search of a world of beauty not known to man.</p>
<p>I imagine that the pigeons and the little green aliens would be laughing at us, as they sit on the intergalactic equivalent of Hawaii.</p>
