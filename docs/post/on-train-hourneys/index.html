    <h2 id="a-perfectly-known-future-is-already-the-past">A perfectly known future is already the past</h2>
<p>When you’re on a long train journey through India, you’ll see a lot of “small stations” where most of the trains dont stop. Even if they do, that’s usually not for the sake of someone to get off/board the train. The trains stop there only when they’re ahead of time, or if they have some issue with the route ahead.</p>
<p>When I look at these stations, I feel a weird urge to get off into that small station, especially during night time. One does not really know what one should do after getting off into a random station in a small village at night, and that is exactly the point. To not know what the future holds.</p>
<p>To fall in love is like getting off on a small station. The very feeling of not knowing what’s going to happen, yet knowing that you want it.</p>
<p>Some get off just for a while. Others get off to stay.</p>
<p>As much as we humans want to build time machines, we’re not really ready for it. Do you really want to know exactly how your next trip would be ? Do you really want to go on a trip to a place as familiar as home ?</p>
<h2 id="station-to-station-ashes-to-ashes">Station to station, ashes to ashes.</h2>
<p>Life is kind of like sitting beside a window on a train. We watch everything go by outside, and a lot of us feel good for the fact that we’re safe on this train, and not out there in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get off into random stations for a few minutes, just for the heck of it. It sure does get our moms worried, but it’s always worth the thrill.</p>
<p>We make friends with the people around us, and for the sake of the journey itself, we avoid conflicts. Because we know that this journey is temporary, and the fact that we’ll never meet them again once we get off at our stations.</p>
<p>The difference is that in life, we don&rsquo;t know when we have to get off the train. It would also be fair to say that most of us have forgotten the fact that it is indeed temporary, and we really don&rsquo;t know when our station would arrive.</p>
<p>One day, after getting off the train, we&rsquo;ll be one with that world out there, and watch the trains go by on a breezy evening.</p>
